# Summary

The [Field] curriculum is a **complete education in [Field]** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate [Field] majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.
When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro*: for students to try out [Field] and see if it's right for them
- *Core*: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a [Field] curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
- *Advanced*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a [Field] curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
- *Final Project*: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide

**Duration**. It is possible to finish within about 1 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.
- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week. A popular option is to take the math courses in parallel with the introductory courses. Course prerequisites are listed to help you determine if you are prepared for a given course.
- Courses in Advanced are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. ) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading.
- 
**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Respect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

## Prerequisites

....

## Intro CS

This course will introduce you to the world of [Field]. This course gives you a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, [Field] is likely for you!

**Topics covered**:
`computation`
`imperative programming`
`basic data structures and algorithms`
`and more`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Discussion
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:

## Core [Field]

All coursework under Core CS is **required**, unless otherwise indicated.

### Core [topic 1]

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Discussion
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:

## Advanced [Field]

After completing **every required course** in Core [Field], students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced [Field] based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

### Advanced [topic 1]

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites

## Final project

Part of learning is doing.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've completed Core [Field] and the parts of Advanced [Field] relevant to you,
you should identify a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
You can create something entirely new, or you can improve some tool/program that you use and wish were better.

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses.
Here is a sample of options
(many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):


## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above,
you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:
